Minitiarized Version of a Command Shell
=======================================


The source code can be compiled to build a program that works as
a minitarized version of a command shell. This program can run
the majority of commands that you would type into the command
line. It handles command argumetns with arguments and paths
that are both relative and absolute. 

If a command is not found a message will print:

Command commandName not found
[replace commandName with the actual command name]
